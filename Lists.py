#TASK 
'''Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
print: Print the list.
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
sort: Sort the list.
pop: Pop the last element from the list.
reverse: Reverse the list.
Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. 
Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.'''

            i, e = map(int, command[1:])
            my_list.insert(i, e)
        elif command[0] == "print":
            print(my_list)
        elif command[0] == "remove":
            e = int(command[1])
            my_list.remove(e)
        elif command[0] == "append":
            e = int(command[1])
            my_list.append(e)
        elif command[0] == "sort":
            my_list.sort()
        elif command[0] == "pop":
            my_list.pop()
        elif command[0] == "reverse":
            my_list.reverse()
